# RecycleAdapter

* in this feature you can create adapter with any type of data using single line of code.
* and provide the onclick, onlongclick of rootview and also you can apply individual view based on ResId.
* you will get onBind listener if required for any further customisation as per your requirements.
* set load more listener for on demand based data load.
* also provide the custom layout handler as per your requirements.
* both side swipe menu support.
* multiple layout support (header, footer, customs xml etc).
* Also I used databinding concept, so donâ€™t worry about null value :) 
* Code :-
```java   
/*
      with -> first argument is your list and second argument is your binding object but remind to you, your all list item
              layout file in same binding name define like  
              <data>
                 <variable name="item" type="pojo class path" /> 
              </data>
      map -> here i am set two list item one is header and second is point, so it will automatically handle the layout file
             bind in list based on your give class.
